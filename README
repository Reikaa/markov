please see the docstring in the main script for more extensive documentation.
for your convenience I copied some of it here:

class MarkovChain(object):
	"""
	generate pseudo-random texts based on markov chains
	
	- calculates how likely a certain words follow a given word or phrase
	- (use an existing text to determine the probabilities)
	- start with an initial word or phrase
	- do a random walk over the "space of words"
	- when choosing the next word, respect the determined probabilities
	- obtain a meaningless text that somewhat resemebles the original text
	
	For usage of the module/class, see the bottom of this file.
	"""
